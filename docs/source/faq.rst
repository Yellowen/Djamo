1. What does Djamo means ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Djamo** means nothing, its just Django + Mongo - go

2. Why do you build an other one?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. I'm not satisfied with exists drivers.
2. I don't need a complex driver, a simple and handy one is better for me.

3. Why did you start Djamo version from 2.67?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Because I'm a big fan of **Steins Gate** anime. The main character *Okarin* use 2.67 version always as the begining version of his works.
