Djamo Quick Start Guide
=======================
**Djamo** API is very similar to `PyMmongo <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`_, But **Djamo** provides an OOP way to use PyMongo.

Let's begin
-----------
.. highlight:: python

After installing **Djamo** you have to add some configuration data to ``settings.py`` file of your Djanog project. Add a settings variable called ``DJAMO`` to your settings and specify MongoDB connection information in that. for example::

    DJAMO = {
        "name": "test_database",
	"host": "localhost",   # This option is optional and its default value is 'localhost'
	"port": 27017,   # This option is optional and its default value is 27017
	"max_pool_size": 10,  # This option is optional and its default value is 10
	"max_age": 1200,  # This option is optional and its default value is 400, Djamo
	                  # will keep alive the connection for max_age seconds
    }

**Djamo** tries to stay as simple as possible, so it's very easy to use it. Djamo provides two main class to represent your data model. :py:class:`~djamo.document.Document` is the base class for representing a MongoDB document. :py:class:`~djamo.document.Document` is a **dict**
subclass and it's optional to use it, You can simply use a dictionary just like the way PyMongo do, But using :py:class:`~djamo.document.Document` brings you some useful advantages. For example you can
specify a ``fileds`` property for your :py:class:`~djamo.document.Document`, **Djamo** will use it for validate and serialize your data (Don't worry you will learn it soon).

Other useful class is :py:class:`~djamo.collection.Collection` which represent a MongoDB collection. As i told earlier in this document **Djamo** has a API very similar to  **PyMongo**'s. So :py:class:`~djamo.collection.Collection` is a subclass of PyMongo Collection and share the same methods as PyMongo.

Let's see some examples, Here is a simple Document/Collection to represent a Student::

    from djamo import Collection, Document


    class Student (Document):
        pass


    class Students (Collection):
       document = Student

It's easy, isn't it? The `Student` class is document with no specific property and `Students` class is a collection that use `Student` document as its default document. Each collection should define a ``document`` attribute which used for serializing and de-serializing collection data, if no document specified **Djamo** will use normal python dictionary to work with collections data. Now its time to use above
code and do some query on database::

    student_a = Student({"name": "Uchiha Sasuke",
                         "age": 19})

    student_b = Sudent(name="Uzumaki Naruto", age=18, uid=3975611745)

    student_c = Student()
    student_c.name = "Rock Lee"
    student_c["age"] = 21

    students = Students()
    students.insert([student_a, student_b, student_c])

Here you can see that a :py:class:`~djamo.document.Document` subclass can be initialize eather by passing a dictionary or by using keyword argyments. Also you must know about how to access your document attributes, since document is a subclass of dict
class you can access to a document attributes eather using normal dictionary indexing or class attributes.

We used :py:func:`~djamo.collection.Collection.insert` method of :py:class:`~djamo.collection.Collection` to put a list of students in our database. Remember documents are ``dict`` subclass and MongoDB did not force to stick with the same keys/values for your document, so your document can have any key/value pair your want.

After inserting data it is time to update them. Assume you want to change the ``school`` key of some students with specific ``age``::

    students = Students()
    students.update({"age": 18}, {"school": "school_A"})

In above example we change the value of ``school`` key of all the students in the ``Students`` collection who are 18 years old, to ``school_A``. If they don't have a ``school`` key it will be created.
